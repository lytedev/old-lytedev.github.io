Because the cool kids have one these days, right?

# Development

Since I often come back to projects and it's good to document things, this is
primarily for forgetful ol' me to be able to jump right back in and make
changes.

## Requirements

    gem install jekyll --pre
    gem install rake bundler
    bundle install

Make sure your ruby gem binaries are in your PATH so you can run jekyll, rake,
and bundle after you install them.

## Setup

    rake watch
