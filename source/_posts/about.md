#### Hello! My name is Daniel

I work with computers and the internet and love every second.

The internet is a universe of opportunity. I have a knack and a passion for
building powerfully useful experiences that can greatly simplify lives or simply
draw a crowd.

Technology is an ever-changing and constantly-shifting field of work. I relish
in the quick-moving world of deprecation and development cycles and am
constantly searching for and trying to create the next "best thing."

So this isn't just a job for me.

##### I thrive here!
